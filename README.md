Windows Nodes in OpenShift

This current is tested on Vmware, with two machines, one running OpenShift 3.9 on RHEL 7.5.
A full openshift subscription is required.

The Windows Node is Windows Server Core 1709.
The Windows node requires it to be enabled for Ansible.
bin/winansible.ps1 set's up the windows node for ansible.
